This is the repository for the DORA project. Very much a work in progress at this point.

python dora server
(wait neural net to initialize)
python dora client
(opens in a new window, it will take a while for the image to appear)

To run the tests, `pytest`. To run the rests and code coverage, `pytest --cov`. Both from root directory.

In order to utilize this code:

Our project is designed to utilize Python version 3.5 or greater. A number of dependencies are specified and will be installed with a Pipfile or can be installed manually by referencing requirements.txt. Additionally, a webcam is required.

Installing Python dependencies and utilizing Virtual Environments can be complex and difficult to debug. On occasion, it has been difficult to reproduce the environment. Below are strategies for installing our dependencies in either a virtual environment or system level.

Virtual Environment Setup:

Navigate to the top level dora directory once cloned.
This directory contains our module 'dora' as well a Pipfile and requirements.txt, which specifies our dependencies.
To read more about pipenv, look here: https://docs.pipenv.org/index.html

Pipenv will automatically install all of the required dependencies into a virtual environment.
To install pipenv and the required dependencies as well as run Dora, follow the below instructions:

```bash
[~/Projects/dora] $ pip install pipenv
[~/Projects/dora] $ pipenv install
Pipfile.lock not found, creating‚Ä¶
Locking [dev-packages] dependencies‚Ä¶

To activate this project's virtualenv, run the following:
 $ pipenv shell
[~/Projects/dora] $ pipenv shell
Spawning environment shell (/bin/bash). Use 'exit' to leave.
source /home/will/.local/share/virtualenvs/dora-TLaQji9E/bin/activate
[~/Projects/dora] $ python dora
```
There are instances on Windows machines where python will crash when `python dora` is issues. This is an issue with the pipenv shell. Simply issue `exit` and then issue the command: `python dora`.

System Level Setup:

Alternatively, a requirements.txt file is included and the requirements can be installed via the command below:
```bash
$ pip3 -r requirements.txt
```
If you do not have system admin privileges pip can use the `--user` flag to install to the user's directory:
```bash
$ pip3 --user -r requirements.txt
```

To run Dora when at the top level directory:
```bash
[~/Projects/dora] $ ls
dora  Pipfile  README.md  requirements.txt  setup.py
[~/Projects/dora] $ python dora
....
```

At this point, our dashboard will open. Some debugging will be output to the console. After the dashboard window opens, it may take some time for the video feed to appear on the right hand side as the neural net initializes and then begins to interpret frames.

'''
pip3 install pipenv
pipenv --three
pipenv install [--dev]

In order to run tests and coverage reports, use this command:
```bash
(dora-TLaQji9E) will@will-Falco:[~/Projects/dora] $ pytest --cov=dora
