This project is an object detection system developed for Wisconsin Robotics to use in the Mars Rover Competition. The system will be used to detect gate markers, hazards, and drivable surfaces during the autonomous traversal task of the competition. This was developed as a semester long project for CS 506 at UW-Madison.
